# Wallpaper Scraping with Python + Selenium

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.0
- Selenium (CLI: pip install selenium)

## Using

To use this script, clone this repository, and just type the command `py script.py` inside this folder. For today, it can only download 25 wallpapers, but I will repair and let it download at least 1K, and this is for the future.

When running script, remember that wallpapers wil be downloaded to "assets/img" folder, check it after the script stops running.
